# Project Guidelines — MergePDF

This document tells Junie and contributors how to work in this repository efficiently with minimal changes. It supplements JUNIE_CODING_RULES.md and the general Java coding conventions in java_coding_conventions_v3_claude.md.

## 1) Project Overview
- Name: MergePDF
- Language/Build: Java 21, Maven
- Purpose: Command-line tool (planned) to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF.
- Current status: Skeleton project with a Main class; PDF merge functionality is not yet implemented.

## 2) Repository Structure
- pom.xml — Maven project descriptor (Java 21, UTF-8)
- src/main/java/jp/goodenough/Main.java — Current entry point (placeholder output)
- JUNIE_CODING_RULES.md — Repository-specific coding/operation rules for Junie
- java_coding_conventions_v3_claude.md — Detailed Java coding conventions

Note: target/ is build output generated by Maven and should not be committed.

## 3) How Junie should work on this project
- Minimal diffs: Make only the smallest necessary changes to satisfy the issue.
- Plan and progress: Always publish a plan and keep it updated via update_status.
- Respect existing structure: Keep Maven layout and Java 21 settings unless the issue requires changes.
- Documentation-first for scaffolding: When adding processes or rules, prefer documenting them before adding tooling.
- Follow coding rules: Adhere to JUNIE_CODING_RULES.md for naming, style, exceptions, logging, and tests.

## 4) Build/Run
- Build: mvn -q -DskipTests package
- Run: java -cp target/MergePDF-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar jp.goodenough.Main
- Java version: Ensure Java 21 is used (Maven compiler plugin is configured via properties in pom.xml).

## 5) Tests
- Current tests: None.
- If a change adds testable logic, add JUnit 5 tests under src/test/java following AAA style and the naming pattern <ClassName>Test.
- Running tests: mvn -q test
- For documentation-only or configuration-only changes, tests are not required.

## 6) When to build before submitting
- Code changes to Java or pom.xml: Build locally with Maven to ensure successful compilation.
- Doc-only changes (like this file): Build is optional; no need to run tests.

## 7) Code Style and Quality
- Follow Google Java Style (see conventions doc), line length ~120.
- Prefer records for immutable DTOs; use Optional for return values only.
- Avoid System.out for production logic; use logging guidelines in JUNIE_CODING_RULES.md if/when a logging library is introduced.

## 8) Future work (non-blocking)
- Add actual PDF merge functionality (likely via a PDF library once explicitly approved).
- Provide end-to-end CLI usage examples and tests with sample PDFs.

If any ambiguity exists, ask for clarification via the ask_user tool before making invasive changes.
